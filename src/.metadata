Have fun!!!\n\n\n## CHANGELOG\n\n### v1.1\n\n* **The Crafting Station, called \"Java Factory\"**, is now available. ( #3, #9 )\n\n    To craft Java artifacts, you have to use `\"Java Factory\"` instead of `\"Basic crafting\"`.\n\n* Implement **playable Javabuttons** that behaves like percussion instruments. ( #1 )\n* Now there are two different types of `Javabuttons`: **loungeable** ones and **playable** ones. ( #1 )\n* Implement **Wiring** for the playable `Javabuttons`. ( #4 )\n* Rename objects:\n  * `Red Button` -> `Crimson Javacouch` (loungeable)\n  * `Red Button` -> `Crimson Javabutton` (playable, wirable)\n  * `Ancient Button` -> `Navy Javacouch` (loungeable)\n  * `Ancient Button` -> `Navy Javabutton` (playable, wirable)\n  * `Red Block` -> `Crimson Block`\n  * `Classical copy` -> `Sign of Java`\n* Implement **Java Servers of two different sizes** that work as storages for items. ( #9 ).\n* Fix some Engrish. ( #5, #6, #19 )\n\n\n## Source Code\n\nhttps://github.com/arigato-java/javabound",
